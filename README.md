## Getting Started

### What is Confit?

Confit is web development-tool generator that is designed to evolve as web technologies change. This allows your project's 
build processes to stay up-to-date so you can take advantage of new technology once it becomes mainstream. 

Confit generates tools for the main development processes in web projects:
- develop
- build
- verify
- test
- release

The tooling is generated by answering a series of simple questions about your project, turning a process that used to take weeks to
tune correctly, into a 5 minute step.
