## What is Confit?

> Confit is designed to isolate you from the constant-churn of Javascript frameworks so that you can get started with a build-system
  which "just works". And in a few months time when you want to use newer tools, migration will be easier (than if you hadn't used Confit).

Confit:
- is a web development-tool *generator* that is designed to evolve as web technologies change.
- captures a project's build processes in a build-tool-independent configuration file (confit.json), so you can *migrate your configuration from older tools onto newer tools more-easily*
- is focused on generating tools for single-page web applications (SPAs)
- is **not** the solution for *every* kind of web application that exists
- is **not** going to support obscure features or exceptional cases. It is a build-tool generator for what *the contributors* consider to be the *best setup for **most** people*


Confit generates tools for the main development processes in web projects:
- develop
- build
- verify
- test
- release

The tooling is generated by answering a series of simple questions about your project, turning a process that used to take weeks to
tune correctly, into a 5 minute step.
