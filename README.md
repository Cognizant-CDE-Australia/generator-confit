## Install

    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-confit

## What is Confit?

Confit is a Yeoman generator that generates web-development tools for the main development processes in web projects:

- develop
- build
- verify
- test
- release (coming soon)

The tooling is generated by answering a series of simple questions about your project, turning a process that used to take weeks to
tune correctly, into a 5 minute step. See the animated-gif above for an example.
 
***Out of the box, Confit can generate a sample project for the settings you've chosen and so you can see that everything works!***

### In more detail...

> Confit isolates you from the constant-churn of Javascript frameworks so that you can get started with a build-system
  which "just works". And in a few months time when you want to use newer tools, migration will be easier (than if you hadn't used Confit).


- Confit is a **web development-tool generator** that is designed to evolve as web technologies change.
- Confit captures a project's build processes in a **build-tool-independent configuration file** (`confit.json`), so you can *migrate your configuration from older tools onto newer tools more-easily*.
- Confit is **focused** on generating tools for single-page web applications (SPAs).
- Confit is **not** the solution for *every* kind of web application that exists. It is **not** going to support obscure features or exceptional cases. It is a web development-tool generator for what **the contributors** consider to be the *best setup for **most** people*


## Usage

    yo confit [--skip-install] [--skip-run]
    
- `--skip-install` skips the installation of NPM and Bower dependencies
- `--skip-run` skips the run command, which normally starts the build tool in develop mode (`npm run dev`)
