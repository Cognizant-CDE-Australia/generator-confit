## Install

    npm install -g yo
    npm install -g generator-confit

## What is Confit?

Confit is a Yeoman generator that generates web-development tools for the main development processes in web projects:

- develop
- build
- verify
- test
- release (coming soon)

The tooling is generated by answering a series of simple questions about your project, turning a process that used to take weeks to
tune correctly, into a 5 minute step. See the animated-gif above for an example.
 
***Out of the box, Confit can generate a sample project for the settings you've chosen and so you can see that everything works!***

### In more detail...

> Confit isolates you from the constant-churn of Javascript frameworks so that you can get started with a build-system
  which "just works". And in a few months time when you want to use newer tools, migration will be easier (than if you hadn't used Confit).


- Confit is a **web development-tool generator** that is designed to evolve as web technologies change.
- Confit captures a project's build processes in a **build-tool-independent configuration file** (`confit.json`), so you can *migrate your configuration to use newer build-tools more-easily*.
- Confit is **focused** on generating tools for single-page web applications (SPAs).
- Confit is **opinionated**. For example, Confit does not advocate the use of BowerJS. If you need it, look elsewhere. (Or create an NPM module if one doesn't already exist for the Bower library you need).
- Confit is **not** the solution for *every* kind of web application that exists. It is **not** going to support obscure features or exceptional cases. It is a web development-tool generator for what **the contributors** consider to be the *best setup for **most** people*
- Having said that, Confit does permit **some** configuration (see the animated gif above for an idea).

> Confit wants to capture the information about your project which **will not** change when your build-tooling changes.
  This is the essence of Confit - decoupling your project configuration from the build-tool implementation of that configuration. 
  

## Usage

    yo confit [--skip-install] [--skip-run]
    
- `--skip-install` skips the installation of NPM and Bower dependencies
- `--skip-run` skips the run command, which normally starts the build tool in develop mode (`npm run dev`)

## Upgrading

Confit is designed to be hassle-free when upgrading. As well as using semantic versioning, Confit has some smarts to make upgrading simple even when there are "breaking changes". *It is always a good idea to commit all your source code to a repo BEFORE upgrading, so that if the upgrade doesn't turn out how you expected, you can revert to the previous version of the code.*

Each Confit generator (Confit is composed of multiple generators) contains a version identifier. When you upgrade to a new version of Confit, if any of the new generators have changed, Confit will detect this and the generator will re-ask the questions for that section. That will cause the generator's version in your `confit.json` file to be updated, as well as new information being added to the file in some cases. Old / deprecated information will not be automatically removed.

Similarly for the generated tools, if the tooling changes, or you choose to use a different build profile which uses different tools, the old tools' files will not be removed.
