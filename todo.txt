- Get component-testing working (and add to readme)  (3 hours)
  - Write sample unit tests

- Verify linting works. After running runConit.js to run generator, can run 'npm run verify', then change a file an re-run (3 hours)
  + Eslint test
  - SASSLint test
  - Stylint test

Backlog
- Make Webpack config LESS lively and MORE readable

- Add tests:
  - Unit test for paths (are the paths correct?)
  - npm build:serve (run Protractor test again)

- Fix the relative path in test.files.js so that the correct relative-path is a template variable,
  not hard-coded based on assumptions of location of 'src/' and 'config/' directories.

- Make sure the readme lists the Features of the build (e.g. unit testing, code coverage, js linting, css linting, etc, with a nice 'tick' symbol if possible)

- Create a TODO.md for the project, indicating next steps

- Look at Kent Dodds list of things to implement on a project (ghooks, semver etc, commitizen) and see what can be incorporated into
  <release> step and other generators (https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-module-checklist)

- 'Library' mode?
  - Uses Webpack library flag to output into a certain format
