For Client Demo:
+ BuildCSS: Don't ask for external CSS files list.
+ Extract the bundling-code into it's own builder
+ Change buildCSS and buildJS to not-ask for their entry-point, but that is defined in the bundler generator
+ Ensure this works with GruntJS
+ When running the site, make it load index.html not the confit.html
- Ensure this works with Webpack

Beyond Client Demo:
- If the user presses "spacebar" on the entry-points, it puts an invalid value into the field
- BuildJS: Ask for source-code format (ES5, ES6, <CoffeeScript>), then output format. If ES6 -> ES5 - Babel. ES6 -> ES6 - Nothing. ES5 -> ES5 - Nothing. CoffeeScript -> X - coffeescript
- Get WebPack fully working with a sample project

- Replace confitReport.html with a README.md file, which lists the commands you can use to build and the expected directory format.
  - Need a template README.md
  - Need to be able to use a project's existing README.md and add/replace relevant sections
