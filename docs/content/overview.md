## Introducing **Confit**

**Confit** is a Yeoman generator that generates web-development tools for the main development processes in web projects:

- Developing code
- Building
- Verifying code style (linting)
- Testing code
- Packaging code
- Releasing code

The tooling is generated by answering a series of simple questions about your project, turning a process that used to take weeks to
tune correctly, into a 5 minute step!
 
*Out of the box, Confit can generate a sample project for the settings you've chosen and so you can see that everything works!*

## Developing code

Confit is designed to get you *started* writing code, but it is not designed to be a code-scaffolding tool. Rather,
Confit will generate the tools to allow you to compile, lint, test, document, package and release your code.

To help you develop code, Confit asks the following questions


Tasks:
- Generate a sample application
- Writing code
- Verifying code
- Testing code
- Generating documentation
- Creating a package & releasing it
