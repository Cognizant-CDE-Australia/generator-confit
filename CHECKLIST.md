- [x] watch the [egghead.io][egghead] series [How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library][egghead series];
it is extremely useful for any NPM project (OSS or closed-sourced).

- [x] start unit testing right away, [pick your unit testing framework][pick testing framework]

- [ ] start linting code to prevent obvious problems, like misspelled variable.
[eslint][eslint], [jshint][jshint], [jscs][jscs] or all of them together
[gulp-lint-everything][gulp-lint-everything]

- [ ] run linting and unit tests on each commit locally. [pre-git][pre-git], [ghooks][ghooks]

- [x] validate commit message using [pre-git][pre-git] or [commitizen][commitizen] with [validate-commit-msg][validate-commit-msg]. This
enables other tools, like intelligent release notes.

<!--- [ ] show the project's GitHub open issues on demand or on commit using [git-issues][git-issues]-->

- [x] setup continuous integration server, like [TravisCI][travis] or [CircleCI][circle] (or wait until you set up [semantic-release][semantic-release] which will set up [TravisCI][travis] for you).

- [x] [add badges][badges] to the README to make broken unit tests or out of date dependencies visible
  - [x] ci server badge
  - [x] published NPM package info [NodeICO][nodeico]
  - [x] production and dev dependencies being out of date [david-dm][david-dm]
  - [x] semantic release badge

- [x] check module published size and white list only necessary files, [tutorial][module size]

- [x] setup [semantic-release][semantic-release] to automate publishing
and avoid breaking [semver][semver]. This is [important][semver important],
but is currently [broken][broken semver] in too many projects. Even this checklist is using semver!

- [x] avoid surprises by using exact versions of the top level dependencies.
Use [save-exact][save-exact] NPM setting and [exact-semver][exact-semver] to enforce it.

- [ ] setup a script to reliably update out of date dependencies using [next-update][next-update install]
  - [ ] setup automatic pull requests when newer versions of dependencies appear [greenkeeper.io][greenkeeper]

- [x] if writing a CLI tool, add a way to check if it is out of date and should be upgraded;
[update-notifier][update-notifier]

- [x] catch missing or invalid `package.json` values using [grunt-nice-package][grunt-nice-package]
or [fixpack][fixpack]

- [x] write simple installation commands for your module

- [x] write "quick intro" example showing the main feature of your module

- [x] add CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear guidelines how others can add new features or fix bugs
in your module. [Atom editor][atom] and [lodash][lodash] have excellent examples to follow.
When GitHub finds a CONTRIBUTING.md file it [shows a message][contributing] to anyone opening an issue.

- [ ] generate documentation automatically. [xplain][xplain] is my own tool for JS to HTML/Markdown
generation

- [x] place most of the public API documentation in README file for simple retrieval.
This allows other developers to find relevant sections right from the command line [manpm][manpm]
or by looking up `npm home package-name`
